## 📝 Problem Statement

The **Dead Stock Register (DSR) Management System** is designed to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies inherent in the traditional, manual process of tracking non-consumable lab inventory. The existing system is prone to errors, time-consuming, and lacks the ability to provide real-time updates or secure access to different stakeholders.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 🚀

### 🌐 Frontend
- **React**: Used to build the dynamic and interactive user interface of the DSR system, including forms for user input, the dashboard, and real-time updates for managing the stock register.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed to create a sleek, responsive design for the entire application, ensuring that the UI is both modern and mobile-friendly.
- **react-icons**: Integrated for adding intuitive icons throughout the application, improving visual cues for actions like editing, deleting, and navigating the UI.
- **react-modal**: Utilized to create custom modals for user confirmations, such as confirming the deletion of a department or prompting for additional details.

### 🖥️ Backend
- **Node.js**: Powers the backend server, handling API requests, processing business logic, and serving data to the frontend.
- **Express**: Manages routing and middleware on the backend, enabling CRUD operations for users, departments, and register entries. It handles the core logic for role-based access control (RBAC) and data validation.
- **Mongoose**: Facilitates interaction with MongoDB, allowing for the definition of schemas for users, departments, and register entries. It also manages relationships and data validation within the database.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: Implements secure user authentication, generating tokens that verify a user’s identity and role before allowing access to protected routes and operations.
- **Multer**: Used for handling file uploads within the application, particularly for uploading documents or images related to the stock register entries.

### 💾 Database
- **MongoDB**: Stores all the data for the DSR, including user information, departments, register entries, and logs of changes. The flexibility of MongoDB allows for easy updates and queries on the hierarchical data structure.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Hosts the MongoDB database in the cloud, providing automated backups, scaling, and monitoring, ensuring the DSR system is always available and performant.

### 📜 PDF Generation and Emailing
- **jsPDF**: Generates PDF versions of the Dead Stock Register entries, allowing users to download or print reports directly from the application.
- **jsPDF autoTable**: Adds structured tables to the PDFs, ensuring that the generated reports are well-organized and easy to read, especially when handling large datasets.
- **Nodemailer**: Automatically sends emails to relevant users when updates are made to the register, such as when a new entry is added or an existing entry is modified. This keeps all stakeholders informed in real-time.

### 🔒 Security and Environment Management
- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables, keeping sensitive information like database URIs, API keys, and JWT secrets secure and easily configurable across different environments.
- **CORS**: Configured to allow secure cross-origin requests from the frontend to the backend API, ensuring that only authorized clients can interact with the server.

### 🔄 Development Tools
- **Nodemon**: Used during development to automatically restart the Node.js server whenever changes are made to the backend code, improving developer efficiency.
- **axios**: Handles HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend, used extensively for fetching and submitting data such as user authentication, register entries, and department details.

   npm i
    ```

- 3 - Create a `.env` file in the server folder and define the following variables:

   - ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: This is a secret key used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to secure user authentication.

   - MAILER_TRANSPORTER_SERVICE: Set this to gmail to configure Nodemailer to use Gmail as the email service provider.

   - MAILER_AUTH_ID: This is the email ID used for sending emails via the Nodemailer transporter.

   - MAILER_AUTH_PASS: This is the password or app-specific password for the MAILER_AUTH_ID account, required for authentication. [Youtube Guide](https://youtu.be/MkLX85XU5rU?si=A1eVoJwHBZDsg15i)

   - MAILER_FROM_ID: The email address that will appear in the "From" field when sending emails through the system.

   Example `.env` file:
   ```bash
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   MAILER_TRANSPORTER_SERVICE=gmail
   MAILER_AUTH_ID=your_email@gmail.com
